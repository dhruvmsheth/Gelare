Depth-sensing and Spatial movement algorithms used





<h3> Algorithm 2: Calculation of movement of Robotic Arm to spatial location of fruit. </h3>
Given below is the algorithm to calculate the angle required to be turned by the Robotic arm to reach the position in the `X,Y` plane.

The next step is to calculate the angle required to be taken in the `Z` direction by the Robotic Arm to exert only the required amount of pressure on the Fruit.
